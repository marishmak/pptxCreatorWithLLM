The cascade is trained to reject negative sub-images early on, reducing computation time. Classifiers in the cascade are trained using AdaBoost on remaining positive examples. The Viola and Jones cascade has 38 stages with over 6000 features trained on 4916 positive and 9544 negative examples. It can handle various scale images due to its ability to process at different sizes. There are other recognition techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), which also attempt to find an optimal hyperplane to separate data. \\n'], ['This website provides access to a vast library of free e-books on various topics. \\n'], ['This edition was first published in 2014 by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Consider a simple example with a hole in a gray area, where we focus only on pixels within the hole. In a sequence of two images, edge points are marked in green.

The difference image highlights areas of change. However, analyzing these differences is challenging.  OpenCV provides the `absdiff` function for computing the frame difference.  A running average, calculated as the average of the last `k` frames, can be used to account for background changes.  To avoid storing all `k` frames, aging is applied, using a learning rate `α` to update the running average.  OpenCV's `accumulateWeighted` function facilitates this with a learning rate parameter.   The running average adapts to lighting changes but can also incorporate moving objects. \\n\"], ['Face recognition using the technique described in this chapter uses a cascade of classifiers to identify features.

Humans use multiple senses, like sight, sound, touch, and smell, to perceive the world. While most machines rely on simple input devices, such as keyboards and mice, or wired/wireless communication channels, recent years have seen the integration of cameras and microphones as standard components in computers and mobile devices. This advancement, coupled with increased processing speed, enables meaningful data processing.  Computer Vision aims to automate image and video understanding in machines. It encompasses techniques for tasks ranging from industrial inspection to guiding autonomous robots. This book introduces this exciting field, covering image processing basics and providing tools to solve practical problems. Computer vision systems are becoming ubiquitous, found in homes, game consoles, cameras, phones, streets, offices, and factories, offering functionalities like face detection, license plate recognition, biometric verification, and robotic guidance. The field is still in its early stages, with more applications expected. MATLAB and OpenCV are two prominent platforms for developing computer vision solutions. MATLAB facilitates rapid prototyping, while OpenCV, a high-quality library for C and C++, with wrappers for Python and Java, offers implementations of state-of-the-art vision techniques.

Additionally, the parked car has not been included in the background, resulting in a halo effect around its position. The background model is a grayscale image. To address this, we can alter the selective update to update the background even for foreground pixels with a lower learning rate. This ensures that the foreground pixels are included in the background, but with a lower weight than the background pixels, resulting in a smoother transition. \\n'], ['Counting Bicycles, Recognise Paintings \\n'], ['This edition was first published in 2014 by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.
